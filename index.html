  <p>A person would never guess that the sweet, loving animal who greets them at the door descended from a dangerous and scary animal. Dogs have descended from wolves, an animal known to be feared by many people. The adaptations started almost accidentally when the wolves were domesticated by following the hunters around and eating their garbage. Dogs can now form strong emotional bonds with their owners that could last their whole lifetime. Dogs are also very intelligent. They can be trained in specific ways to help different people. For example, seeing-eye dogs help blind people to navigate on sidewalks and build around objects the person may not see. Some dogs are trained as police dogs, drug-sniffing dogs, herding dogs, therapy dogs, service dogs, etc. Dogs are not only cute pet they can also be useful to society. Pictured below are dogs performing some of the aforementioned jobs. </p>
